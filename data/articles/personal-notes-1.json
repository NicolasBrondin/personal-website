This one above is the kind we say and write everyday, but today it was a bit harder because it means more than it regularly do when I use it. \n\n Today it means that I am starting something new, that I’m stepping outside my comfort zone by starting these writing sessions, which you can call a blog if you like, a journal if you prefer, or any other word which can represent this (future) bunch of written notes. \n\n > Why and why now?"
